Hello Everyone!! I will be uploading useful python scripts for daily use for free!

To use these scripts, you may use an online compiler on a separate tab/window, and then copy and paste the raw code.

For example: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

Script 1: CPP Caculator script to calculate your redemption value for flight or hotel bookings.

Script 2: CSV to JSON script to export certain columns to a json file.

There will be more scripts uploaded to this repository.

Hope these scripts are useful to you!
